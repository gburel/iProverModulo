<H3>Architecture</H3>

iProverModulo [Bur11] is an extension of iProver [Kor08] to integrate Polarized
resolution modulo [Dow10]. 
Polarized resolution modulo consists in presenting the theory in which the 
problem has to be solved by means of polarized rewriting rules instead of
axioms. 
It can also be seen as a combination of the set-of-support strategy and 
selection of literals.
<P>
iProverModulo consists of two tools: First, autotheo is a theory
preprocessor that converts the axioms of the input into rewriting
rules that can be used by Polarized resolution modulo. Second, these
rewriting rules are handled by a
patched version of iProver 0.7 which integrates Polarized resolution modulo.
The integration of polarized resolution modulo in iProver only affects
its ordered resolution calculus, so that the instantiation calculus is
untouched.
<P>
iProverModulo 0.7-0.3 outputs a proof that is made of two parts:
First, autotheo print a derivation of the transformation of the axioms
into rewriting rules. This derivation is in TSTP format and includes
the CNF conversions obtained from E. Second, the modified version of
iProver outputs a Dedukti proof from this rewriting rules and the non-axiom
formulas, following the ideas of [Bur13].


  
<H3>Strategies</H3>

Autotheo is first run to transform the formulas of the
problem whose role is "axiom" into polarized rewriting rules. 
Autotheo offers a set of strategies to that purpose.
For the competition, the Equiv and the ClausalAll strategies 
will be used. 
The former strategy orients formulas intuitively depending of their
shape. It may be incomplete, so that the prover may give up in certain cases. 
However, it shows interesting results on some problems. 
The second strategy should be complete, at least when equality is not 
involved. 
The rewriting system for the first strategy is tried for half the time 
given for the problem, then the prover is restarted with the second strategy 
if no proof has been found.
<P>
The patched version of iProver is run on the remaining formulas
modulo the rewriting rules produced by autotheo. No scheduling is
performed. To be compatible with Polarized resolution modulo, literals
are selected only when they are maximal w.r.t. a KBO ordering, and orphans
are not eliminated. To take advantage of Polarized resolution modulo,
the resolution calculus is triggered more often than the instantiation
calculus, on the contrary to the original iProver.
<P>
Normalization of clauses w.r.t. the term rewriting system produced by
autotheo is performed by transforming these rules into an
OCaml program, compiling this program, and dynamically linking it with
the prover.

<H3>Implementation</H3>

iProverModulo is available as a patch to iProver. 
The most important additions are the plugin-based normalization engine and 
the handling of polarized rewriting rules.
iProverModulo is available from
<PRE>
  <A HREF="http://www.ensiie.fr/~guillaume.burel/blackandwhite_iProverModulo.html.en">http://www.ensiie.fr/~guillaume.burel/blackandwhite_iProverModulo.html.en</A></PRE>
Since iProverModulo needs to compile rewriting rules, an OCaml
compiler is also provided.
<P>
Autotheo is available independently from iProverModulo from
<PRE>
    <A HREF="http://www.ensiie.fr/~guillaume.burel/blackandwhite_autotheo.html.en">http://www.ensiie.fr/~guillaume.burel/blackandwhite_autotheo.html.en</A></PRE>
Autotheo uses E to compute clausal normal form of formula. The version
of E it uses is very slightly modified to make it print the CNF
derivation even if no proof is found.
<P>
Both of autotheo and iProver are written in OCaml.

<H3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

The core of iProverModulo was untouched since last time it entered the
competition in CASC-24. However, compilation of rewriting rules failed
at the time, so a slight improvement is to be expected this year.

The main modification is that iProverModulo now outputs a  proof.
